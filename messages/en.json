  "faq": {
    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)",
    "q1": "How much capital do I need for options trading?",
    "a1": "The minimum deposit varies by broker (€0 to €2,000). However, for meaningful diversification, you should plan for at least €5,000-10,000. Keep in mind that one option contract typically covers 100 shares.",
    "q2": "Are options suitable for beginners?",
    "a2": "Options are complex financial instruments with significant risks. Beginners should first educate themselves thoroughly, practice with a demo account, and start with simple strategies (e.g., covered calls). Education is essential.",
    "q3": "What is the difference between European and American options?",
    "a3": "European options can only be exercised on the expiration date. American options can be exercised at any time until expiration. Most stock options are American, index options are often European.",
    "q4": "Do I have to hold options until expiration?",
    "a4": "No. You can close option positions at any time before expiration through an offsetting transaction. Most traders close positions early to realize profits or limit losses.",
    "q5": "How is the option premium calculated?",
    "a5": "The option premium consists of: Intrinsic value (difference between stock price and strike) + Time value (influenced by remaining time, volatility, interest rates, and dividends). The Black-Scholes model is the best-known valuation model.",
    "q6": "What happens if I don't have shares and an option is exercised?",
    "a6": "If you sold an uncovered (naked) option and it's exercised, you must buy the shares at market price (for calls) or sell them (for puts). This can lead to significant losses. Therefore, margin requirements for uncovered options are high."
